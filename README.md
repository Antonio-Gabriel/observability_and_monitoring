# OBSERVABILITY AND MONITORING OF SOFTWARE

Hi there,<br>

I'm AntÃ³nio Gabriel, I'm angolan and currenly I work as a software developer with some stacks in front and backend such as `Python`, `Php`, `Javascript`, `Go` and more.

In this article I will talk a little about observability and monitoring of softwares and I might create an example using tools of observability and monitoring.

So let's get started.

First we need to understand what observability and monitoring is, why we need it in our softwares (use case specifications), when to use and how to apply.

We start to answer the first point.

## 1. What's Monitoring and Observability?

DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) define **monitoring** as a tools or technique solution that allow the teams monitorise and understand the state of system.

And **Observability** as a tools or technique solution that allow the teams debug activally a system, exploring properties and patterns not defined with advance.

> Once we understood the concepts we can already say that monitoring is an item essential to teams of large performance and in addition to several other technique practices, contribute positively to continuous delivery.

## 2. Why do we need it in our projects.

To answer these points we need to understand some questions related to our clients and performance of application.

- You need reports about the general integrity of your system and ask: <br>
 
        1. Our system is running?.
        2. Our systems have sufficient resources available?. 

- You need reports about the state of your system according the experiences of your clients and ask: <br>

        1. Our clients know if the system is down and have a bad experience?.

- You need to monitor the main metrics of business and system.
- You need tools that help you to understand and debug your system in production.

There are other points related to cases that you can have in your project but I listed only some of them.

These are some common questions that you ask to you to know what's the cases I need monitored or what I need to monitor.

So observability and monitoring go more than thought, in many cases we need thought in how to manage the state of application and user experience.

### 2.1 When use.

The observability and monitoring were created to:

- Provide indicators that lead to interruption and degradation of services.

- Detecte interruptions, degradation of services, bugs and activities not authorized.

- Identify tendencies of long time to planning of capacity and business.

- Help to debug interruptions, degradation of services, bugs and activities not authorized.

So as all resources of DevOps, the installation of a tool is not sufficient to reach the objectives, but can help on work.

Below, you can find an example that illustrate a implementation of observability and monitoring of software.

A complete eccosystem to illustrate.

So we can already define the same in simple term bellow I copy the figure that define.

## 3. How to apply.
